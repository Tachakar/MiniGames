# MiniGames

Project built with Django and TypeScript. I'll capture my learning journey using this repo. 
It includes some basics from Django like: templates, views, user authentication, working with database etc. 

# Setup
1) Create folder, run git init and pull from this repo.
2) Create venv and source it.
3) Run pip install -r requirements.txt
4) Open settings and change SECRET_KEY (generate random one from https://djecrety.ir/), in DATABASE change USER and PASSWORD to 'admin'. App will run but you wont login into admin panel.
5) Go to wordle/ and run tsc for .ts files to compile.
6) Run python3 manage.py runserver.
